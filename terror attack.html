        <h2><center><u>Mumbai Terror Attack 26/11</u></center></h2>
        <p>The 2008 Mumbai attacks were a series of terrorist attacks that took place in November 2008, when 10 members of Lashkar-e-Taiba, an Islamist terrorist organisation from Pakistan, carried out 12 coordinated shooting and bombing attacks lasting four days across Mumbai.</p>
        Connection To Pakistan In This Attack:-
        <p>With evidence pointing to the attacks’ having originated within Pakistan’s territory, India on November 28, 2008, requested the presence of Lieut. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, director general of Pakistan’s intelligence agency, as its investigation process got under way. Pakistan at first agreed to this request but subsequently backpedaled, offering to send to India a representative for the director general instead of Pasha himself. The immediate impact of the attacks was felt on the ongoing peace process between the two countries. Alleging inaction by Pakistani authorities on terrorist elements, Pranab Mukherjee, India’s external affairs minister, stated, “If they don’t act, then it will not be business as usual.” India later canceled its cricket team’s tour of Pakistan that had been scheduled for January–February 2009.</p>

        <u><h2 align="right">Fidayeen attack on Indian Air Force base</h2></u>
        <p>alighnOn 2 January 2016, six militants attacked the Pathankot Air Force Base in the Indian state of Punjab, with
            the intention of destroying the airplanes and helicopters on the tarmac. Before the intruders could reach
            the runway or aircraft, base personnel confronted the infiltrators and alerted security personnel of their
            presence. After a cook killed one of the militants with the attacker’s own rifle, security personnel cornered
            and killed three other intruders. The remaining two attackers hid in an unoccupied barracks while security
            forces rushed to protect the airfield, any remaining aircraft, and other high-priority targets. Many hours
            later, the two remaining militants ambushed unsuspecting base personnel, leading to an assault on the
            two-story barracks by specialized Indian military and security personnel. Due to this second surprise
            attack, Indian security forces then conducted a thorough search of the entire base to ensure no other
            intruders were still at large. In addition to the six attackers killed, ten Indian military personnel were killed
            in action and another 22 people were wounded. Indian governmental officials claimed the Jaish-eMohammed terrorist group conducted the attack.
